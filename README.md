# Adventure Game 🎮

This is a 2D sandbox exploration game, similar to a 2D version of Minecraft. It features infinite procedurally generated tile-based terrain, combat, NPCs controlled using the A* algorithm, and local game data saved to CSV files.

This project was my first project using Unity and C#, developed as part of my A-level coursework. I was teaching myself C# and OOP while developing it so please note that this game is not meant to be a comprehensive representation of my current abilities.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you! 💬

Thank you for checking out my game. I hope you enjoy playing it! 🙏
